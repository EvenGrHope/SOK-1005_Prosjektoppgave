In this GitHub Repo is my SOK-1005 Projectassignment.
The assignment was made in R version: 4.2.1

The repo is meant to be downloaded directly into Rstudio and rendered into a html file using quarto.
The repo is split into two part:

1) The datawrangling which can be found inside the Data folder. 
   The SOK-1005_Prosjektoppgave_V23_Data.qmd wont run because the data is not uploaded into the git repo (too large).
   You could download the data (see sources inside the .qmd file) and add it to a "Data_Files" folder with appropriate names and it will run.
   The Dataframe_Project.csv file inside the Data_Files folder is the output of the SOK-1005_Prosjektoppgave_V23_Data.qmd file. 
   Do not move any files around into different folders.

2) The main part of the assignment is located inside the SOK-1005_Prosjektoppgave_V23.qmd.
   Make sure to run the SOK-1005_Prosjektoppgave_V23_Data.qmd first.
   The assignment will output a html document when rendered and was made to look best using Google Chrome.
